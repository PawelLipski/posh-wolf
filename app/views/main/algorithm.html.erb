We solve the problem by the means of optimization algorithm known as cuckoo search, elaborated by ###CHK TODOODODODODO!!! Xin-She Yang and Suash Deb in 2009.
#By assumption, it represents ##brood behavior of cuckoos. Potential solution instances are represented by eggs, located in nests. In the basic version of the algorithm #employed #for this #problem, each nest keeps at most one egg. Who provide new solutions are the cuckoos, each of them remembers one solution instance.

#solution->candidate

As soon as initial nest &ampl cuckoos population is randomized, optimization process starts. In every iteration a single cuckoo is randomly chosen and its solution is modified in a random way. Various strategies are employed #to modification. Yang and Deb prove in their article that the optimal one are so-called L#kreska!#evy flights, but we did not follow this path due to implementational difficulties. Posh Wolf uses simple random walk instead - a modified egg (solution) is placed in a randomly chosen nest, if only it #super the egg that was placed there before.

Solution quality is estimated using a #target function - and in the case of flow shop problem it is the total #sprawdzic, czy to jest ok# execution timespan. The algorithm aims, of course, to minimize this time, i.e. to minimize the time that passes between the first job starts and the very last jobs completes.

At the end of each iteration, a number of the worst solution candidates is removed and substituted with randomly generated ones.

The general outline of algorithm, as proposed by Yang &amp; Deb, is as follows:
